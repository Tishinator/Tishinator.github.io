    "introduction": "My name is Michael Tishman, but most people call me Tish.",
    "bio": "I am a Software Engineer with a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from the Florida Institute of Technology. Programming has always been an interesting concept to me. Whenever I bump into a small problem or something bothers me, I turn to coding. It's pretty cool how many of my projects start just because I wanted to fix something small or make life a bit easier. With a bit of code, I can solve these issues, and it feels amazing. It's not just about fixing things; it's about creating and learning along the way. That's why I love programming—it lets me tackle problems in my own creative way. "  }
